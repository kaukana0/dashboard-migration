# Intro

The task is to create a website for Eurostat B.4, which presents an interactive overview for various Eurostat data.

In ESTAT B.4 terminology, such an overview is called a "dashboard".

The data comes from a REST API from ESTAT.
It's mainly time-series OLAP data with ~6 dimensions about so called "indicators".

The REST endpoint is the only backend needed - the dashboard itself is purely front-end.

There exist already several dashboards.
However, they're architecturally not readily re-usable to fit the requirements of this particular one.

In essence, regarding the look and feel, this dashboard is supposed to be somewhat similar to the "globalization dashboard":
https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/dashboard/globalisation

The main differences lie in:
- the look-and-feel: it should adhere to the new stylguide (2022/2023)
- the logic of a certain dropdown-selectBox: it combines two dimensions "c_birth" and "citizen" and allows only for certain combination of selections
- the logic of the max number of lines shown in the line chart (reagrding both, country select and c_birth/citizen select) - see also req750 and req350
- the country's select box's "favourite star" functionality behaves differently (req580)

For more technical details, please see also the "architecture decision records".
